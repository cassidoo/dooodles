Dooodles
========

Dooodles is a game where you can draw with your friends from your mobile devices.  Say you have a gathering of buddies and you want to play a thrilling game of Pictionary, but alas, there's no whiteboards and how enough pens to go around.  Never fear.  We've got you covered.

Setting up a Dooodles game is easy!  Just go to our website on your desktop and come up with a room name.  All of your friends can log in on their phones and form teams right away.  Then, it's easy as pie.  Everyone takes turns drawing on their respective mobile devices, and teams can guess what their drawing master is doodling directly from their phones as well!

With hundreds of words available, Dooodles can keep the party going for hours.  Try it out for yourself and see!
